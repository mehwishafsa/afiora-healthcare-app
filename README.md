# 📱 Afiora Healthcare App  

Afiora Healthcare is a **prototype healthcare application** designed to make healthcare services more accessible, especially for rural and semi-urban communities.  
This is my **first major GitHub project** after two smaller beginner projects, and it reflects my journey of learning app development while solving real-world healthcare challenges.  



## ✨ Current Features  

- 🏥 **Book Appointment** – Schedule visits with doctors  
- 👨‍⚕️ **Doctors Directory** – Browse and connect with doctors  
- 📂 **My Health Records** – Store and view medical records offline  
- 💊 **Pharmacy Availability** – Check availability of medicines in local pharmacies  
- ❓ **FAQ Section** – Quick answers to common healthcare-related questions  
- 🚨 **Emergency Help** – One-tap emergency support for patients in need

- 🔲 Wearable device support (fitness trackers, vitals monitoring)  
- 🔲 **Sign Language to English Translator** – Anime-inspired virtual assistant/toy that interprets sign language gestures and translates them into English text/speech to help doctors communicate with patients who cannot speak  



## 📌 Roadmap  

- ✅ Publish APK prototype  
- ✅ Add screenshots & project documentation  
- 🔲 Upload source code (future Android/Flutter migration)  
- 🔲 Add authentication & secure login  
- 🔲 Deploy cloud backend for real-time data

## 👩‍💻 About Me  

I am a **beginner developer** exploring mobile app development, cloud computing, and AI/ML integration.  
This project marks my first step into building **impactful, real-world applications**.  

I already have two other projects on GitHub, and Afiora Healthcare App is my **first end-to-end prototype** that I plan to grow into a scalable digital health ecosystem.
